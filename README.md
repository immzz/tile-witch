**TileWitch** - A 2D Tile-based Map Editor

###1. What is TileWitch?
**TileWitch** is used for creating 2d maps for tile-based games.

###2. What's special about TileWitch?
**TileWitch** generates tilsets from any kind of tile image resources and creates your map in a highly expressive way, while requiring minimal effort for learning. 
**TileWitch** comes with two components: **TileCreator** and **MapEditor**. The **TileCreator** allows you to create tilesets from any kind of tile image resources, which means your tile images don't have to be preprocessed at all. The workflow is very fast and intuitive. The **MapEditor** allows you to create your map on a large canvas(up to 200*200 tiles). By working with **TileCreator**, it provides automatic collision area marking so that you don't have to be distracted by the old tidious process. **MapEditor** also provides multi-layer creation, which enriches the scope of your creation.
